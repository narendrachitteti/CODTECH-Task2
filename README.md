## Overview of the project

## Project:Student Grades Management

###Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a Java program to track and manage student grades. The program allows users to input grades for different subjects or assignments, calculate the average grade, and display the overall grade along with additional information such as letter grade and GPA.

###Key Activities
- **Grade Input:** Allow the user to input multiple grades.
- **Average Calculation:** Calculate the average of the entered grades.
- **Grade Conversion:** Convert the average grade into a corresponding letter grade.
- **GPA Calculation:** Calculate the GPA based on the letter grade.
- **Result Display:** Display the average grade, letter grade, and GPA to the user.
- **Error Handling:** Handle invalid grade inputs and ensure grades are within a valid range (0-100).
  
###Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Java
- **Development Environment:** Any Java development environment (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or a simple text editor with command-line tools)
- **Libraries:** No external libraries are required. The program uses the Scanner class from the Java Standard Library for user input and ArrayList for storing grades.
